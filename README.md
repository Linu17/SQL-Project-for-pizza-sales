Pizza Sales Analysis (SQL Project)
In this project, I explored a pizza sales dataset using SQL to uncover actionable business insights. I answered 13 business-critical questions ranging from total revenue and order patterns to top-performing pizzas by category and time of day.
Highlights:

Used advanced SQL techniques (joins, aggregations, window functions) to derive meaningful insights.

Analyzed revenue contribution and order volume trends.

Delivered strategic recommendations based on data analysis.

Compiled findings into a professional report.
